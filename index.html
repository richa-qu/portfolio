                <h3>Eye Tracker (September 2024 - November 2024)</h3>
                <p>Worked with a team to create a Python program that scrolls through a page depending on where the user is looking. Used a pre-trained model called Haar Cascade to detect the eye position and where the pupil is to determine where the user is looking. Worked on the calibration to see where the eye is looking.</p>

            <h2>Organizations</h2>
            <p><strong>The Diggeridoos at Virginia Tech (January 2024 - Present)</strong><br>
            Worked as an embedded software engineer. Created and worked with our sensor classes in C++ and Arduino for our Tunneling Boring Machine. I was specifically tasked with testing the code of the sensor classes to see if the behavior matched the actual measurements. Achieved 2nd place at the Not-A-Boring Competition in March 2024.</p>
            <p><strong>AI4ALL (September 2024 - Present)</strong><br>
            Participated as a student in the AI4ALL program. Created a Python program that detects where a user is looking on the screen. Used supervised learning and worked in collaboration with other students using git.</p>
